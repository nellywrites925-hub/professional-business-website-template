#### **Behind-the-Scenes Post:**

🧵 The story behind my $67 website template that's helping businesses go online:

6 months ago, I noticed a problem:
→ Small businesses need professional websites
→ Custom development costs $2,000-5,000
→ Cheap templates leave people confused and frustrated

So I built the solution I wish existed:
→ Professional template ✅
→ Beginner-friendly guides ✅
→ Commercial use rights ✅
→ Complete success system ✅

The result? Customers are launching professional sites in hours, not weeks.

Sometimes the best business opportunities come from solving your own frustrations.

What problem have you turned into a business opportunity?

🧵 Thread: How I built and launched a $67 website template that solves a real problem

1/ The Problem: Small businesses need professional websites but can't afford $2K-5K for custom development

2/ The Gap: $15 templates exist, but they dump files on you with no guidance. People get frustrated and give up.

3/ My Solution: Not just a template - a complete success system with step-by-step guides

4/ What's Included:
→ 5-page responsive template
→ 50+ page beginner's guide
→ Professional demo site
→ Commercial license
→ Deployment guides

5/ Key Differentiator: I don't just sell files. I sell success. Customers can build professional sites in 3 hours instead of 3 weeks.

6/ Early Results:
→ Launched on Gumroad 48 hours ago
→ [X] sales already
→ 4.9/5 star reviews
→ Customers sharing success stories

7/ Lesson: People don't buy products. They buy better versions of themselves.

My template doesn't just give them files - it gives them the confidence and capability to succeed online.

#### **Quick Tips Posts:**

```
💡 Quick tip: When choosing a website template, don't just look at the design.

Ask these questions:
→ Are guides included?
→ Is support available?
→ Can I use it for clients?
→ Will I actually succeed with it?

Most templates fail the last question.

```

```
🎯 Unpopular opinion: A $67 template with great documentation is worth more than a $15 template that leaves you confused.

Time is money. Frustration costs more than the price difference.

Invest in your success, not just the cheapest option.
